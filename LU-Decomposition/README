This function performs LU decomposition with pivoting on a given square matrix A. 
The LU decomposition decomposes a matrix into a lower triangular matrix (L) and an upper triangular matrix (U), such that A = L*U. 
The function also returns a permutation matrix (P) that records the row exchanges.

Inputs:
  A: coefficient matrix

Outputs:
  L: lower triangular matrix
  U: upper triangular matrix
  P: permutation matrix

Example of how to use the function:
Suppose you want to perform LU decomposition with pivoting on the matrix A = [3 6 9; 2 5 1; 7 4 8]. 
You can use the function as follows:
  A = [3 6 9; 2 5 1; 7 4 8];
  luFactor(A);
The function will return the lower triangular matrix L, the upper triangular matrix U, and the permutation matrix P. You can then verify that A = LUP^(-1) by computing LUP^(-1) and comparing it with A.
