linearRegression Computes the linear regression of a data set
Inputs:
  x: x-values for our data set
  y: y-values for our data set

Outputs:
  fX: x-values with outliers removed
  fY: y-values with outliers removed
  slope: slope from the linear regression y=mx+b
  intercept: intercept from the linear regression y=mx+b
  Rsquared: R^2, a.k.a. coefficient of determination
  
To use the function, you would call it with the x and y values of the data set you want to analyze. 
For example:
  x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
  y = [2, 4, 5, 4, 6];
  linearRegression(x, y);
In this case, fX and fY will be arrays with outliers removed, slope and intercept will be the slope and y-intercept of the linear regression line,
respectively, and Rsquared will be the R-squared value of the linear regression.
