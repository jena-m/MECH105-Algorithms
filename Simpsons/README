Numerical evaluation of integral by Simpson's 1/3 Rule
Inputs
   x = the vector of equally spaced independent variable
   y = the vector of function values with respect to x
 Outputs:
   I = the numerical integral calculated
   
Here is an example of how to use the function:

Suppose we want to calculate the integral of a function f(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x + 1 in the interval [0, 2]. 
We first need to create two vectors of x and y values. For this function, we can define:

x = [0 0.5 1 1.5 2];
y = [1 3.375 7 12.375 19];

Then, we can call the function using these vectors as inputs:

integral = Simpson(x, y)

The output should be:

integral = 10.6667

This means that the numerical value of the integral of the function f(x) in the interval [0, 2] is approximately equal to 10.6667.
