# MECH105-Algorithms

Welcome to my GitHub folder containing a collection of algorithms I created during my time as a student in the MECH 105 class. These algorithms were written in MATLAB and are designed to solve a range of numerical problems commonly encountered in engineering and science. Currently, this folder includes functions for false position, LU decomposition, linear regression, and Simpson's 1/3 rule.
