This function uses the false position method to find the root of a given function within a user-defined interval. 
The purpose of the function is to perform linear regression to approximate the root of a function.

Inputs:
  func: the function to be evaluated.
  xl: the lower bound of the interval.
  xu: the upper bound of the interval.
  es (optional): the desired relative error (default value: 0.0001).
  maxit (optional): the maximum number of iterations (default value: 200).
  varargin: additional arguments to be passed to the function.

Outputs:
  root: the approximate root of the function.
  fx: the function value at the root.
  ea: the approximate relative error.
  iter: the number of iterations performed.

Example of how to use the function:
Suppose you want to find the root of the function f(x) = x^3 + 4x^2 - 10 within the interval [1, 2] with a desired relative error of 0.01. 
You can use the function as follows:

  f = @(x) x^3 + 4*x^2 - 10;
  falsePosition(f, 1, 2, 0.01);
  
The function will return the approximate root, the function value at the root, the approximate relative error, and the number of iterations performed.
